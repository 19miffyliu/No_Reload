# No_Reload

# Introduction

Are you annoyed that the shotgun ammo takes up inventory slots? Do you hate reloading the gun? Do you want to roam around in the facility with your shotgun while also collecting scraps?

Well, this mod is for you!

# Description
You can now:
- Shoot the gun how many times you like.
- Reload the gun for infinite amount of time using only one ammo.

# Config Options

I suggest **only enabling one** of the config options.

## Infinite ammo in inventory

**Enabled:** You can now reload the gun without consuming the ammo in the inventory. **Need to have 1 ammo in inventory for it to work.**


**Disabled:** The ammo in the inventory will be consumed when reloading.


## No Reload

**Enabled:** You can now shoot the gun how many times you want without needing to reload anymore. **Need to have at least 1 ammo loaded in gun for it to work.**


**Disabled:** You will need to reload the gun after two shots, just like in vanilia gameplay.
